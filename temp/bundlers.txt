!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Bundlers  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-> vite , Parcel, Webpack
create react app -> uses babel and WebPack

!!!!!!!!!!!! Parcel 
-> Its a Package.
-> Its a module of js Files.
-> For managing package we use package manager (use npm/yarn)
npm -> it manages a lot of packages as we want lot of packages in our Project.
"For Building a react App we need a lot of superPowers which comes from a lot of helper Packages to manage those Packages in our Project we need npm".

-> Dependency means all the Project that our Project needs .
 -> Dependency is something on which our Project depends 
  -> Parcel is such a Dependency as we need bundler for optimizing our App.

  Version:
     -> Sign before Version -> Wil the Version Should Auto Upgrade or not
    -> ^ -> Carret -> For minor Versions
    -> ~ -> Tilde -> For major Versions
    -> else I just want this Version dont need any Updates in our Versions.

   Package-Lock.json
    -> to Know the Exact Version Of the Library we are using we need Package-Lock. 
    -> It Locks the version it is the proof of what exact version we use.
    -> Never Put this in gitignore.Always Put it in github.
    -> It maintains the hash(Integrity) whatever version is on local should be the same as on Production.

    Node_Modules:
     -> Its a kind of Database for Your Project.
     -> We Should put them into .gitignore 
     -> we never put in git as packagelock.json can generate the Node_Modules.
     -> We should put parcel.cache in our gitignore.
